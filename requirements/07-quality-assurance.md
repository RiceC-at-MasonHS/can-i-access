### QA-05: Edge Case Testing
- **MUST** test edge cases:
  - Empty CSV files
  - CSV files with no URL column
  - Malformed URLs

  - CORS policy restrictions
  - Invalid CSV formats
  - Browser storage limitations
  - Print dialog cancellation

## Performance Testing

### QA-07: Load Testing
- **MUST** verify performance with large URL sets

- **MUST** verify timeout handling works correctly

### QA-08: Real-time Feedback Testing
- **MUST** verify progress indicators update correctly
- **MUST** test status color accuracy
- **MUST** ensure real-time feedback matches final results
- **MUST** verify filter functionality with various result sets

## User Experience Testing

### QA-09: Workflow Testing
- **MUST** test complete workflows:
  - CSV upload → testing → filtering → manual verification → printing
  - Manual URL entry → testing → export
  - Google Sheets loading → filtering → reporting
- **MUST** verify state persistence during operations

### QA-10: Accessibility Testing
- **MUST** verify keyboard navigation functionality

### QA-13: IT Department Workflow Testing
- **MUST** verify reports meet IT department needs
- **MUST** test print output quality and formatting
- **MUST** verify CSV exports work with common spreadsheet software
- **MUST** validate actionable recommendations provide value

## Regression Testing

### QA-14: Feature Regression Prevention
- **MUST** maintain test checklist for all core features
- **MUST** verify HTTPS upgrade logic continues working
- **MUST** ensure YouTube detection remains accurate
- **MUST** confirm manual testing modal functionality

### QA-15: Performance Regression Prevention
- **MUST** monitor for performance degradation

### QA-17: Error Message Testing
- **MUST** verify all error messages are user-friendly
- **MUST** test error message accuracy for different failure types
- **MUST** ensure technical errors are translated to actionable guidance
- **MUST** verify fallback options are clearly presented

## Deployment Testing

### QA-18: Single-File Deployment
- **MUST** verify application works as single HTML file
- **MUST** test with various web server configurations
- **MUST** ensure no external dependencies are required
- **MUST** verify offline functionality (local file access)

### QA-19: Version Control and Updates
