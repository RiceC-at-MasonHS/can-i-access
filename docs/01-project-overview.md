# Can I Access? - Project Overview

## Purpose
**Can I Access?** is a browser-based tool designed to help educational institutions test URL accessibility from within their school networks. It provides teachers, IT departments, and administrators with clear insights into which educational resources are accessible, blocked, or require manual verification.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Teachers & Educators**: Need to verify educational resources are accessible for curriculum planning
- **IT Departments**: Require documentation for network policy adjustments and whitelisting decisions
- **School Administrators**: Need reports for policy review and compliance documentation

### Use Cases
1. **Pre-lesson Planning**: Teachers test educational URLs before including them in lesson plans
2. **IT Troubleshooting**: Identify blocked educational resources that should be whitelisted
3. **Policy Documentation**: Generate reports for network policy reviews and compliance
4. **Resource Auditing**: Bulk test educational resource lists for accessibility

## Core Value Proposition
- **Network-Aware Testing**: Tests URLs from within the actual school network environment
- **Educational Focus**: Optimized for common educational content (YouTube videos, educational sites)
- **IT-Friendly Reports**: Generates actionable documentation for IT departments
- **No Installation Required**: Browser-based tool requiring no server setup or installation

## Key Differentiators
1. **School Network Context**: Tests from within the actual restricted environment
2. **YouTube Video Detection**: Aggressive detection of removed/private YouTube videos
3. **HTTPS Upgrade Logic**: Automatically attempts to upgrade HTTP URLs to HTTPS
4. **Manual Verification**: Provides tools for manual testing of uncertain results
5. **Professional Reporting**: Print-ready reports for IT department workflows
