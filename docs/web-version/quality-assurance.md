# Web Version Quality Assurance

## Testing Strategy

### QA-WEB-01: Browser Testing
- **MUST** verify functionality across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **MUST** test with different browser security settings
- **MUST** verify print functionality in each browser
- **MUST** test CSV export capability across browsers

### QA-WEB-02: Network Condition Testing
- **MUST** test under various network conditions:
  - Fast institutional internet
  - Slower connections with higher latency
  - Networks with aggressive content filtering
  - Networks with HTTPS inspection/modification

### QA-WEB-03: Test Data Management
- **MUST** maintain comprehensive test CSV files including:
  - `test-filtering.csv`: Diverse URLs for filter testing
  - `test-youtube-cors.csv`: YouTube video availability testing
  - `test-http-https.csv`: HTTPS upgrade testing
  - `test-modal.csv`: Manual testing workflow verification

### QA-WEB-04: Edge Case Testing
- **MUST** test edge cases:
  - Empty CSV files
  - CSV files with no URL column
  - Malformed URLs
  - Very long URLs
  - URLs with special characters and encoding
  - Large CSV files (100+ URLs)

### QA-WEB-05: Performance Testing
- **MUST** verify performance with large URL sets
- **MUST** ensure UI remains responsive during bulk operations
- **MUST** test memory usage with extended operations
- **MUST** verify timeout handling works correctly

## User Experience Testing

### QA-WEB-06: Workflow Testing
- **MUST** test complete workflows:
  - CSV upload → testing → filtering → manual verification → printing
  - Manual URL entry → testing → export
  - Google Sheets loading → filtering → reporting
- **MUST** verify state persistence during operations

### QA-WEB-07: Accessibility Testing
- **MUST** verify keyboard navigation functionality
- **MUST** test screen reader compatibility
- **MUST** verify sufficient color contrast
- **MUST** test with browser zoom levels (100%-200%)

### QA-WEB-08: Mobile Responsiveness
- **SHOULD** test on tablet devices (secondary use case)
- **MUST** ensure table overflow handling works correctly
- **MUST** verify filter buttons wrap appropriately
- **SHOULD** test touch interface compatibility

## Integration Testing

### QA-WEB-09: School Network Testing
- **MUST** test within actual school network environments
- **MUST** verify accuracy of accessibility detection
- **MUST** test with various content filtering systems
- **MUST** validate YouTube detection under school network conditions

### QA-WEB-10: IT Department Workflow Testing
- **MUST** verify reports meet IT department needs
- **MUST** test print output quality and formatting
- **MUST** verify CSV exports work with common spreadsheet software
- **MUST** validate actionable recommendations provide value

## Deployment Testing

### QA-WEB-11: Single-File Deployment
- **MUST** verify application works as single HTML file
- **MUST** test with various web server configurations
- **MUST** ensure no external dependencies are required
- **MUST** verify offline functionality (local file access)

### QA-WEB-12: GitHub Pages Integration
- **MUST** test deployment on GitHub Pages
- **MUST** verify all functionality works with HTTPS hosting
- **MUST** test cross-promotion links to CLI version
- **MUST** validate professional presentation
