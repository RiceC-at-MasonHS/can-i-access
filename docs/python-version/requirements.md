- **MUST** announce worker thread count at start of operations

### REQ-CLI-UI-03: Progress Indication

- **MUST** announce worker count at operation start (e.g., "Using 5 worker threads")
- **MUST** respect rate limiting to avoid overwhelming networks
- **MUST** handle network timeouts and errors gracefully
- **MUST** provide fallback to sequential processing if needed
- **MUST** display worker configuration in debug mode

### REQ-CLI-ADV-02: Filtering and Sorting
- **MUST** support filtering results by status:
  - `--filter accessible` - Show only accessible URLs
  - `--filter blocked` - Show only blocked URLs
  - `--filter warnings` - Show URLs with warnings

- **MUST** implement sorting by importance/priority
- **MUST** preserve filter settings in exported results

### REQ-CLI-ADV-03: Professional Reporting
- **MUST** generate reports in multiple formats:
  - Console output (default)
  - CSV format (`--output report.csv`)
  - JSON format (`--output report.json`)
  - HTML format (via separate report command)
- **MUST** include all metadata from source CSV
- **MUST** provide institutional-quality documentation
