# Technical Architecture Requirements

## Browser Compatibility

### TECH-01: Browser Support
- **MUST** support modern web browsers:

- **MUST** implement proper CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- **MUST** use fetch API for network requests
- **MUST** handle browser security restrictions appropriately

## Code Architecture

### TECH-03: File Structure
- **MUST** maintain clean separation of concerns:
  - `index.html`: Main application structure
  - `script.js`: Core functionality and logic
  - `style.css`: All styling and visual design
- **MUST** use single-file architecture for easy deployment
- **MUST** include comprehensive inline documentation

### TECH-04: JavaScript Architecture
- **MUST** implement modular functions with clear responsibilities
- **MUST** use async/await for asynchronous operations
- **MUST** provide proper error handling and recovery
- **MUST** expose necessary functions to global scope for HTML events

### TECH-05: CSS Architecture
- **MUST** use utility-first approach with custom components
- **MUST** implement responsive design patterns
- **MUST** provide print-specific styling with `@media print`
- **MUST** maintain consistent color and typography systems

## Performance Requirements

### TECH-06: Bulk Processing
- **MUST** process URLs sequentially to avoid overwhelming network
- **MUST** implement configurable timeouts for network requests
- **MUST** provide real-time progress feedback during bulk operations
- **MUST** handle large CSV files (100+ URLs) without browser freezing

### TECH-07: Memory Management
- **MUST** avoid memory leaks during long-running operations
- **MUST** clean up event listeners and timeouts appropriately
- **MUST** handle large result sets efficiently in DOM

## Network and Security

### TECH-08: Network Testing Methods
- **MUST** implement multiple testing techniques:
  1. Image loading (favicon.ico) for basic connectivity
  2. Fetch with no-cors mode for content accessibility
  3. YouTube oEmbed API for video availability
- **MUST** respect browser CORS limitations
- **MUST** handle network timeouts and errors gracefully

### TECH-09: Security Considerations
- **MUST** not require or store any sensitive information
- **MUST** operate entirely client-side with no data transmission
- **MUST** handle user-provided URLs safely
- **MUST** not execute or embed untrusted content

### TECH-10: HTTPS Handling
- **MUST** implement automatic HTTP to HTTPS upgrade testing
- **MUST** validate HTTPS connectivity before falling back to HTTP
- **MUST** report security implications of HTTP-only access
- **MUST** prioritize secure connections in all testing

## Data Handling

### TECH-11: CSV Processing
- **MUST** implement robust CSV parsing handling:
  - Quoted fields with embedded commas
  - Various line ending formats (CRLF, LF)
  - UTF-8 encoding support
  - Flexible column detection
- **MUST** validate and sanitize input data

### TECH-12: Results Storage
- **MUST** store results in JavaScript objects with consistent structure
- **MUST** maintain result state during filtering and manual testing
- **MUST** track original URLs separately from final tested URLs
- **MUST** preserve detailed test logs for debugging and reporting

## Error Handling

### TECH-13: Graceful Degradation
- **MUST** continue operation when individual URL tests fail
- **MUST** provide meaningful error messages for different failure types
- **MUST** distinguish between network errors, timeouts, and blocks
- **MUST** never crash the application due to individual test failures

### TECH-14: User Feedback
- **MUST** provide clear error messages in user-friendly language
- **MUST** offer suggestions for resolving common issues
- **MUST** log technical details for troubleshooting while keeping UI clean
- **MUST** provide fallback options when primary methods fail
