# Documentation Organization Overview

## New Structure

The documentation has been reorganized into three main categories for better clarity and maintenance:

### 📁 `shared/` - Common Requirements
Requirements that apply to both web and Python versions:
- **`project-overview.md`** - Project purpose, audiences, and value proposition
- **`core-functionality.md`** - URL testing, CSV processing, educational content requirements

### 📁 `web-version/` - Browser-Based Tool
Requirements specific to the web-based interface:
- **`requirements.md`** - UI, browser compatibility, and web-specific features
- **`quality-assurance.md`** - Web testing strategy and validation

### 📁 `python-version/` - Command-Line Tool
Requirements specific to the Python CLI tool:
- **`requirements.md`** - CLI interface, zero-dependency architecture, deployment
- **`bug-fixes.md`** - Recent fixes and development notes
- **`quality-assurance.md`** - CLI testing strategy and validation

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Consistent Formatting
- **Requirement IDs**: Standardized format (REQ-CORE-01, REQ-WEB-UI-01, REQ-CLI-ARCH-01)
- **MUST/SHOULD language**: Clear obligation levels throughout
- **Structured sections**: Logical grouping of related requirements

### ✅ Clear Separation
- **No duplication**: Requirements only appear in appropriate sections
- **Shared concerns**: Common functionality in shared folder
- **Version-specific**: Unique requirements in dedicated folders

### ✅ Better Organization
- **Logical flow**: Project overview → Core functionality → Version-specific details
- **Easy navigation**: Clear folder structure and consistent naming
- **Maintainable**: Each file has focused scope and responsibility

## Benefits of New Structure

### For Developers
- **Clear scope**: Easy to find requirements for specific version
- **No confusion**: Shared vs. version-specific requirements clearly separated
- **Easier maintenance**: Changes only affect relevant files

### For Project Management
- **Better tracking**: Requirements organized by implementation area
- **Clearer priorities**: Version-specific features clearly identified
- **Easier validation**: QA requirements aligned with implementation

### For Users
- **Focused documentation**: Each version has dedicated, comprehensive requirements
- **No information overload**: Only relevant requirements for each tool
- **Better understanding**: Clear separation of concerns and capabilities

## Status

✅ **Documentation reorganization complete** - All requirements consolidated into clean, maintainable structure.

## Ready for Development

The documentation cleanup is complete and the structure is now optimized for:
- **CLI Development**: All Python CLI requirements and bug tracking in `python-version/`
- **Web Development**: All browser tool requirements in `web-version/`
- **Shared Understanding**: Common requirements clearly defined in `shared/`

This clean foundation supports efficient development and maintenance of both versions of the Can I Access? project.
